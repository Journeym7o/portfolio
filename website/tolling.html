          <div class="problem-divider"></div>
          <p class="case-description">Tolling is a contract-based process where a company sends raw materials to a processor to be converted into finished products. The ownership of the material stays with the company, while the processor is compensated through a fee or a portion of the output. </p>
          <p class="case-description">The process is highly complex: it involves managing contracts, transport, processing times, output ratios, fees, penalties, and even pricing risks. Every step has to match up, otherwise mistakes can lead to losses. </p>
          <p class="case-description-black"">There was no existing software that could cover the entire workflow. Most companies were still managing it with Excel and emails, which was messy and error-prone. We were able to turn these complicated rules into a clear and usable system that makes the process more efficient and transparent. </p>

              <p class="case-description">Our team traveled to London for several days of intensive on-site interviews. Through direct conversations with stakeholders, we mapped the end-to-end tolling workflow for the first time and gained a holistic view of the project.</p>

                <p class="case-description-black">Through our early research, we learned that the tolling workflow starts when the mine shares assay results, which trigger the creation of a lot in the system. Each lot must then be assigned a Quotational Period (QP) under strict rules before it can be allocated to a roaster. Once allocated, the company places production orders for MoOx or FeMo, and the roaster processes the material according to agreed timelines and fees. Finally, balances are tracked to reconcile inputs, deductions, and finished outputs against contractual obligations.</p>

            <p class="case-description-black">Tolling in metals is far more complex than a standard supply chain process. Unlike commodities with uniform specifications, metal lots are distinguished by grades rather than fixed standards. Roasters evaluate incoming lots by grade, and each grade comes with its own tolling fee, packaging requirement, incoterm option, and conversion timeline. These variables stack together, making cost and scheduling highly sensitive to even small changes. </p>

          <div class="text-content">
            <p class="case-description">What makes it more intricate is the practice of blending. Lower-grade lots can be combined with higher-grade ones to reach an intermediate quality, which reduces conversion costs compared to processing poor-quality lots separately. This blending is a paper-based adjustment that directly impacts fees and contractual obligations. </p>
            <p class="case-description-black"">In practice, grades are not static. Lots can be re-negotiated between producer and roaster. For example, a grade C lot may be elevated to grade B if both sides agree on adjusted terms. This fluidity means that tolling systems must handle not only contractual rules like M+5 QP declarations, obligations, and balances, but also real-world dynamics like grade negotiations, blending strategies, and variable conversion times. </p>

          <h3 class="case-title">Contracts</h3>
          <p class="case-description">Contracts are the fastest way to understand how the entire tolling process works. Each contract typically comes with a wide range of clauses, often varying from case to case. To bring structure, we analyzed existing agreements, identified the most common and universal terms, and designed the system to support them directly while also allowing optional inputs for customization. </p>
            <div class="problem-divider"></div>
            <p class="case-description">In current practice, teams rely on large Excel spreadsheets, cutting them into sections and building formulas to simulate allocation outcomes. These ad-hoc models help them decide which contract and roaster will maximize value, but the process is manual, error-prone, and hard to maintain.</p>
            <p class="case-description-black">To support this, we extended the platform’s existing contract workflows by introducing a contract split feature. Once a parent contract is defined, users can quickly generate child contracts that reflect specific terms or timeframes. Alongside this, we integrated Excel reading capabilities, enabling users to analyze and reference contract data directly within the system.</p>

            <h3 class="case-title">Allocation</h3>
            <p class="case-description">Allocation is the feature most critical to the front office. Lots usually require third-party assays before they can be allocated, meaning users must first upload assay results into inventory. Once a QP (Quotational Period) is declared, the lot becomes locked and cannot be reallocated. </p>

            <p class="case-description-black">To digitize this, we invested heavily in the allocation design, producing 21 draft workflows that went through multiple rounds of user and technical reviews.</p>

            <p class="case-description-black">We divided the feature into two main views. The first is a balance view, modeled after users’ Excel habits but built on a structured data model for clarity. The second is an allocation view that integrates balances through the concept of batches and combines delivery with allocation. A calculator at the bottom displays floating results to reduce manual work and better reflect real supply chain logic.</p>
          <p class="case-description">These decisions not only matched user expectations but also significantly reduced development effort. Early testing showed strong acceptance from users, while the system’s architecture remains scalable for future enhancements.</p>

In tolling, balances are not static—they must be recalculated against assays, contracts, and operational outcomes.
